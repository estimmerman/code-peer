# CodePeer
Connecting CS students with peer tutors.

This is an application which offers a convenient way for students to collaborate with teaching fellows, tutors, and peers on computer science projects or assignments. Now there's no need to leave your room to get help!

I was inspired to create this project due to the often chaotic atmosphere of office hours at Harvard. I knew there was a better way to receive assistance on assignments than raising your hand for an hour before being helped. This application substitutes in-person office hours with an online equivalent!
